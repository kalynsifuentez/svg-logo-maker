# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

A Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). The application prompts the user to select a shape `(Triangle, Square, or Circle)`, color, text color, and provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

#### Requirements
The application uses [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
